Infrastructure Deployment with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This document outlines the process for deploying and configuring your infrastructure using an IaC tool. The example utilizes Terraform, but the concepts can be adapted to other IaC tools.

Requirements:

Cloud provider account (Azure)
Terraform installed (https://www.terraform.io/)

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://<your_github_username>/<your_infrastructure_repo>.git

Configure Terraform Provider:

Edit the providers.tf file and configure the block for your chosen cloud provider with your access credentials. Refer to the official Terraform documentation for specific provider configuration details.

Review Configuration Files:

The infrastructure directory contains Terraform configuration files (.tf extension) defining your infrastructure components. Each file is commented to explain its purpose and configuration options.

Deployment Steps:

Initialize Terraform:

cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform validate


terraform plan
terraform apply
Example Configuration Files:

The infrastructure directory may contain various configuration files depending on your specific infrastructure needs. Here's a generic example structure:

main.tf: Defines the overall infrastructure layout and references other configuration files.
virtual_machines.tf: Defines virtual machine configurations (size, image, etc.).
networking.tf: Defines network resources (VPNs, subnets, etc.).
